**1. Two definitions**
  * Arthur Samuel 1959:  Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. 
  * Tom Mitchell 1998: Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from **experience E** with respect to some **task T** and some **performance measure P**, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. 
  
**2. Supervised learning**
  * Classification: discrete valued output (0 or 1)
  * Regression: predict continuous valued output 
  
**3. Unsupervised learning**
  * Clusters
  * Unclusters
  
**4. Others**
  * Reinforcement learning 
  * Recommender systems
